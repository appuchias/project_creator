## **How it works**

This project automates the repetitive taskk of creating a folder with the same files every time you decide to start a new project of your own. With this script you will be able to place all the files you want to be cloned into your new folder inside the `toClone` folder and after you run the file, they will be placed in their correspondent folder. Make sure you set up the necessary environmental variables _before_ you run the file so it can find them.

Its usage is HIGHLY recommended with [open_project](https://github.com/appuchias/open_project)

## **Setup**

1. Navigate to the desired folder: `cd <path>`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/project_creator.git`
1. Navigate into the repo folder: `cd project_creator`
1. Setup environmental variables (Template [here](template.env), rename to `.env`)

    - TOKEN

        Your (private repo creation allowed) GitHub token

    - DEST

        The folder where new projects' folders will be created into.

    - SCRIPTS_FOLDER_NAME

        The name of the folder to use if you specify scipt type file.

1. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run the file: `python create.py [-h] [-l] [-py] [-s] project_name`

- **[Tip!]** Add `create` to PATH or create a script which runs it (or both) to make it more versatile. (More info [here](PathAddition.md))
