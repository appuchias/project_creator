# How it works
You'll need to create a settings.json file including `path` and `token` for new projects path and [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), respectively.

[NOTE: You can add the folder to PATH to make it easier to run]

After that, just by using `python create.py <name of the project>`

# Setup
1. Navigate to the desired folder: `cd <path>`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/project_creator.git`
1. Navigate into the repo folder: `cd project_creator`
1. Create `settings.json` and add 'path' and 'token' as shown in **How it works**
1. [OPTIONAL] -> Add the folder to PATH
1. Run the file: `python create.py <name of the project>`
